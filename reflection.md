Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
The Bees Class simulates a swarm of bees exploring a landscape. Each method allows the bees to interact with their environment. The bees can:  
grab(): pick up any object in the environment    
drop(): drop an object that the swarm may have picked up   
examine(): pick up an obeject and inspect it   
use(): allows the bees to use an object that may have been picked up   
walk(): take incremental steps in multiple direction  
fly(): allows the bees to move to a desired location without having to take a step at a time   
shrink(): reduces the size of the bee swarm   
grow(): increases the size of the bee swarm   
rest(): allows the swarm to remain at a particular location   
undo(): lets the swarm know that any action taken cannot be undone   
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?   
Accessors: implemented accessors for the swarm name and size and the xy coordinates of the bees location.  
toString(): implemented a toString() to provide basic information about the swarm.  
Overloaded methods: overloaded thhe grow() and shrink() methods to take in the size by which the swarm should be reduced or increased.  
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Again, office hours was helpful. Talking with other students there helped me see how others were thinking of the assignment and really reinforced how flexible an interface is.  
Advice to future students: This is a pretty flexible assignment. Have fun with it!
